Using
=====

After you install the package (instructions in the installing section), you need to import it into any Python file that you will use it in.

You can do this by adding the following line to the top:

.. code-block:: python

    import area4

After doing so, you can use any of the methods listed in the examples section to get the dividers.


.. warning:: In version 1.1.0, the functions changed in the way they operated.  Before 1.1.0, the functions printed the variables, but after the release, they now just return the variable.

And if you want to you can check to make sure the library is working:

.. code-block:: python

    print(area4.area4info())
