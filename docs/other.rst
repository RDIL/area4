Other Functions
===============

This is a list of other functions you may want to use, and what the do in basic terms.

See the API Refrence page for more information.

Splitter
--------

* :meth:`area4.splitter`

and a series of strings to return, divided.
If the first parameter is a number, it looks it up in the divider list.

If only one additional string is provided, nothing is returned.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import area4
    print(area4.splitter(1, "Welcome to", "My **app**"))
    
    # outputs:
    # Welcome to
    # ------------
    # My **app**

---------------------

* :meth:`area4.utils.get_divider_character`
