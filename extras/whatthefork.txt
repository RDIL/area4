Hello, I am here to learn GitHub. My first time here. 
Not sure if this is allowed, but thought I would put this here in the extras folder and hope it would not be in anybody's way while I learn.
It says that a fork is created.  I am not sure yet what a fork is/does.  But we were watching the good life the other day. Hilarious show!  It's on Netflix. And, well she says 'what the fork'.  So yeah.
Cheers, Simone.

Eh, I'll let it slide
