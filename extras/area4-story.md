# area4 Story

This is a document describing how area4 came to be. It started out as an idea by RDIL. He was coding, and was manually typing out dividers, and had a thought ("What if there was a library for this" was that exact thought). So after a little bit of research on how to make a PyPI ready package, RDIL did it. AreaT was born. The name was later changed because area4 sounded better than AreaT. And then Hacktoberfest 2018 came around and so many people helped out in making this project something amazing!
